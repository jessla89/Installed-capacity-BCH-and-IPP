As the energy demand grows, there is a need to meet this demand. As BC Hydro heritage resources alone could not meet this demand, BC Hydro acquires power from Independent Power Producers (IPPs) to help meet B.C.'s electricity needs. These IPP projects are developed by power production companies, municipalities, First Nations and customers. IPPs develop and operate projects using energy resources like wind, water and biomass. 

Existing IPP Resources
As of April 1, 2025, BC Hydro has 119 Electricity Purchase Agreements (EPAs) with IPPs whose projects achieved commercial operation, as defined in their EPA and are considered to be in operation. In total, these projects are capable of delivering approximately 18,662 gigawatt hours of annual supply and approximately 5,298 megawatts of capacity.

By extracting data available on BC Hydro website for Independent power producer projects - in operation, analyses were carried out to learn about the capacity and energy availability of resources by region for each chosen type of IPP resource. 

The following rendered HTMLs give the analysis carried out for each type of IPP resource.
